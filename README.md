## 📝 Installation (Microsoft Word)

2. Click **Add…** and select `tet_TL.dic`  
3. Ensure the dictionary is checked. Optionally, set as default.

## 🧾 Glottal Stop Representation

In Tetum, the **glottal stop** is a phoneme and part of the official alphabet.  
For technical compatibility with Microsoft Word, it is represented using the **ASCII apostrophe `'` (U+0027)**.  

Examples:

la'o
ti'an
ko'alia


This is a **technical choice**, not a linguistic compromise, and ensures reliable spellchecking.
